			description:
				"This project involved creating a dynamic web page for the website of an interior designer using JavaScript and integrating with an API.

				The focus was on the front-end development, where I built a presentation page to showcase the designer's work using provided HTML. This required handling user events and manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript.
				
				Additionally, I developed a login page for the site administrator and a modal for uploading new media, all from scratch. This provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my JavaScript skills.
				
				For the first time, I had access to back-end code to test functionalities, learning how to communicate with an API—a key skill for modern web applications.
				
				The project utilized Figma for design prototypes, Visual Studio Code for development, and GitHub for version control.",
